# BST 201 - Introduction to Statistical Methods

## Organization
Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health

## Supervisor
Dr. Paul Catalano

## Term
2023 Fall Semester

## Course Description
Covers basic statistical techniques that are important for analyzing data arising from epidemiology, environmental health and biomedical and other public health-related research. Major topics include descriptive statistics, elements of probability, introduction to estimation and hypothesis testing, nonparametric methods, techniques for categorical data, regression analysis, analysis of variance, and elements of study design. Applications are stressed. Designed for students desiring more emphasis on theoretical developments. Background in algebra and calculus strongly recommended.

## Teaching Fellow Responsibilities
Teaching responsibilities may include: running a lab session; holding scheduled office hours; holding extra review sessions before exams; grading assignments; maintaining the course Canvas site; assisting with class logistics (e.g., guest speakers); attending class sessions; tracking student attendance and participation; responding to questions from students via email or other means; and other duties as assigned.

# BST 261 - Data Science II

## Organization
Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health

## Supervisor
Dr. Santiago Romero-Brufau

## Term
2024 Spring Semester

## Course Description
This course is an introduction to deep learning, a branch of machine learning concerned with the construction, development, and application of neural networks. Deep learning algorithms extract layered high-level representations of data in a way that maximizes performance on a given task. We will cover a range of topics including basic neural networks, convolutional networks, and recurrent networks, and applications to problem domains like computer vision and speech recognition. Programming (Python) and case studies will be used throughout the course to provide hands-on training in these concepts.
