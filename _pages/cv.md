Education
======
* B.A.in Economics / B.S.in Statistics / Minor in Mathematics in University of California, Los Angeles, 2021
* M.S. in Biostatistics, Harvard University, 2024

Research Experience
======
* 02/2023 - Now: Research Assistant
  * Laboratory for Computational Physiology, MIT Institute for Medical Engineering & Science, Boston, Massachusetts, United States
  * Duties included:
    * Modified custom LSTM deep learning model architecture, based on G-Computation to implement counterfactual predictions under dynamic treatment, to accommodate diverse datasets, and achieved benchmark metric to evaluate and demonstrate the model’s generalizability beyond MIMIC dataset.  
    * Enhanced a custom LSTM model through pre-training and hyper-parameter tuning, resulting in a 5% improvement in individual-level RMSE.
    * Evaluated and compared model performances across various architectures, incorporating delayed prediction techniques, padding adjustments, and diverse evaluation metrics to present organized results for optimal model selection.
  * Supervisor: Dr. Li-wei H. Lehman, Massachusetts Institute of Technology  

* 02/2023 – 08/2023: Research Assistant
  * TIMI Study Group, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, United States
  * Duties included: 
    * Analyzed the mathematical material behind the interactionRCS R package, enhancing its functionality to accommodate a broader range of knot numbers for interactions with restricted cubic splines. 
    * Conducted performance evaluations on diverse datasets, identified and resolved bugs, and compiled comprehensive reports for optimized package functionality.
    * Facilitated the package documentation and submission to R CRAN, running R CMD check and tests to ensure its robustness and adherence to CRAN standards.  
  * Supervisor: Dr. Andrea Bellavia and Dr. Giorgio Enrico Maria Melloni, Harvard University 

* 05/2022 – 09/2022: Research Assistant
  * National NLP Clinical Challenges (n2c2), Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, United States
  * Duties included: 
    * Applied Clinical Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), with manipulation of separation tokens and Next Sentence Prediction property, and Model Ensemble to optimize automatic information extraction of medical notes, and conducted fine-tuning and weighing to achieve a Macro F1 Score of 0.84 on validation data and 0.799 on test data.
    * Proposed potential model modifications for practical applications based on validity of knowledge graph, Unified Medical Language System (UMLS), and Concept Unique Identifier (CUI), and drafted abstracts for AMIA workshop.
    * Initiated research paper about deep learning algorithms, like BERT, in the application of Natural Language Processing (NLP) in the medical fields based on model construction process and experiment results.
  * Supervisor: Dr. Sibo Yan, Johns Hopkins University

* 03/2022 – 01/2023: Research Assistant
  * China National Health Development Research Center, Beijing, China
  * Duties included: 
    * Composed literature review about dyslipidemia and its synergy effect with co-management of hypertension and hyperglycemia over 70 journals, and evaluated community-level prevention based on health economics model.
    * Conducted field visits to local hospitals and medical centers for data collection of current dyslipidemia management system in China, and proposed new health economics model for a more cost-effective treatment based on community level.
    * Facilitated in the preparation of 6th China DRG Pricing and Payment Congress, and drafted invitations for potential topics.
  * Supervisor: Dr. Hui Han, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention
