Education
======
* B.A.in Economics / B.S.in Statistics / Minor in Mathematics in University of California, Los Angeles, 2021
* M.S. in Biostatistics, Harvard University, 2024

Research Experience
======
* 09/2023 - Presnet: Research Assistant
  * Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, United States
  * Duties included:
    * Conducted simulation experiments on cluster to evaluate the performances under different confounder adjustment methods for Average Hazard with Survival Weight (AH-SW) in survival analysis, which is an innovative summary metric with the potential to significantly improve the interpretation of the magnitude of treatment effect on time-to-event outcomes. 
    * Derived the analytical variance of difference and ratio in AH-SW adjusted by Inverse Propensity Weighted Estimator
(IPTW) and Augmented Inverse Propensity Weighted Estimator (AIPTW).
  * Supervisor: Dr. Hajime Uno, Harvard University

* 07/2023 - 12/2023: Research Trainee
  * Mahmood Lab, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, United States
  * Duties included:
    * Adapted laboratory codebase for data preprocessing to sample patches from Whole Slide Imaging (WSI) using unsupervised machine learning techniques, specifically adapting the K-means Clustering to allow for an arbitrary number of clusters and patches, and build search base for following search model.
    * Developed a multimodal search model to retrieve top-similar WSI patches based on given pathological captions and similarity score rankings, utilizing a pre-trained Contrastive Captioners (CoCa) image encoder to create image embeddings and a pertained tokenizer, along with CoCa text encoder, to generate text embeddings.
  * Supervisor: Dr. Faisal Mahmood, Harvard University

* 02/2023 - Present: Research Assistant
  * Laboratory for Computational Physiology, MIT Institute for Medical Engineering & Science, Boston, Massachusetts, United States
  * Duties included:
    * Modified a sequential Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) framework, aiming to estimate expected patient trajectories and treatment outcomes under dynamic and time-varying treatment strategies, to accommodate CVSim datasets, and achieved benchmark metric to evaluate and demonstrate the model’s generalizability beyond MIMIC dataset. 
    * Conducted the experiments on a sequential Transformer framework for implementation on CVSim dataset, achieving a 10% improvement in individual-level RMSE for counterfactual predictions of patient’s outcomes under dynamic treatment.
    * Evaluated and compared sequential deep learning framework performances across various architectures, using pretraining
strategies, delayed prediction techniques, and padding adjustments, presenting results for optimal model selection.
    * Collaborated in writing and submitting the paper *Counterfactual Sepsis Outcome Prediction Under Dynamic and Time-
Varying Treatment Regimes*, which was reviewed and accepted by AMIA 2024 Informatics Summit.
  * Supervisor: Dr. Li-wei H. Lehman, Massachusetts Institute of Technology

    * Analyzed the mathematical derivation behind the interactionRCS R package and enhanced package’s functionality to support an extended range of knot numbers for interaction assessment with continuous covariates modeled by restricted cubic splines, under delta and bootstrapping confidence interval method, allowing custom knot locations by users.
    * Conducted performance evaluations on diverse datasets, identified and fixed bugs, and compiled detailed reports to optimize
package performance.
    * Facilitated the package submission to Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) and maintained GitHub repository.
