I am currently a master student in Biostatistics at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. I completed my bachelorâ€™s degree in Economics and Statistics at University of California, Los Angeles, with minor in Mathematics. 

My research interests are machine learning and deep learning techniques in the application of public health field. I am also interested in survival analysis, statistical modeling, and software development for new statistical methods.
