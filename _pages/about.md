I am currently a master student in Biostatistics at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. My research interests are machine learning and deep learning techniques in the application of  public health field. I am also interested in survival and longitudinal analysis, statistical modeling, and software development for new statistical methods. I completed my bachelorâ€™s degree in Economics and Statistics at University of California, Los Angeles, with minor in Mathematics. 

I worked with Dr. Andrea Bellavia and Dr. Giorgio Enrico Maria Melloni from TIMI Study Group at Harvard Medical School to conduct a major expansion of InteractionRCS package, a tool to facilitate the interpretation and presentation of regression model results where interaction with continuous covariates are present and flexibly modeled with restricted cubic splines. 

Also, I am working with Dr. Li-wei H. Lehman from Laboratory for Computational Physiology at MIT Institute for Medical Engineering & Science to modify custom LSTM deep learning model architecture, based on G-Computation to implement counterfactual predictions under dynamic treatment, to accommodate diverse datasets and improve model performance.

I recently joined Mahmood Lab at the Brigham and Women's Hospital as research trainee to facilitate the development of image-text encoder-decoder foundation model to achieve image search based on caption, under the supervision of Dr Faisal Mahmood and Dr. Max Lu.
