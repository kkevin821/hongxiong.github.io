# Research Initiative

Healthcare often grapples with fluctuating treatment strategies. Tailoring treatment plans as dynamically as they evolve is crucial in maintaining the efficiency of patient care. Our research delves into developing deep learning techniques to realize this vision. A pivotal piece in this endeavor was established by a novel approach based on G-computation for outcome predictions under changing treatment regimes. We're currently pushing boundaries by integrating probabilistic models to further personalize these predictions, setting a new paradigm for patient care.

Inspired by G-Net Structure from Li, R., Hu, S., Lu, M., Utsumi, Y., Chakraborty, P., Sow, D.M., Madan, P., Li, J., Ghalwash, M., Shahn, Z. & Lehman, L.. (2021).

We have already developed sequential deep learning approaches to estimate expected patient trajectories and treatment outcomes under dynamic and time-varying treatment strategies. There are mainly two types of models. The first one is referred
