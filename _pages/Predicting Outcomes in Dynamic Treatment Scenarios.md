# Research Initiative

Healthcare often grapples with fluctuating treatment strategies. Tailoring treatment plans as dynamically as they evolve is crucial in maintaining the efficiency of patient care. Our research delves into developing deep learning techniques to realize this vision. A pivotal piece in this endeavor was established by a novel approach based on G-computation for outcome predictions under changing treatment regimes. We're currently pushing boundaries by integrating probabilistic models to further personalize these predictions, setting a new paradigm for patient care.

We continued our study based on G-Net framework proposed by Li, R., Hu, S., Lu, M., Utsumi, Y., Chakraborty, P., Sow, D.M., Madan, P., Li, J., Ghalwash, M., Shahn, Z. & Lehman, L.. (2021).

In our research, we apply G-computation within observational studies to achieve two main goals: (1) to learn how patient data variables, known as covariates, distribute over time based on past information, and (2) to estimate what might happen under different treatment plans using this learned information. The G-Net framework, based on G-computation mechanism, uses deep learning models to determine these covariate distributions.

We've approached the analysis of covariate distributions by dividing the data into separate groups. In one method, each covariate is modeled individually — this is the 'one variable per box' approach. In another, we've grouped covariates into two categories, which we refer as the 'two variable per box' approach, to model joint distribution from continuous and categorical covariates respectively.
