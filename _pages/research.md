## Research Summary

With a solid foundation in biostatistics, machine learning, and deep learning, I am driven to bridge the gap between data-driven insights and clinical applications. Based on my robust undergraduate training in statistics and mathematics, I was privileged to get the RA positions at TIMI Study Group and Dana-Farber Cancer Institute at Harvard Medical School. These positions allowed me to conduct various research in interpretable statistical models and survival analysis methodologies. 

Moreover, my research experience during Mahmood Lab at Harvard Medical School, as well as the Laboratory for Computational Physiology at MIT Institute for Medical Engineering & Science, allowed me to further explore the applications of deep learning techniques in public health field. 

## Statistical Modeling Research
