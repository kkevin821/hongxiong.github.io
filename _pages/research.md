## Research Summary

With a solid foundation in biostatistics, machine learning, and deep learning, I am driven to bridge the gap between data-driven insights and clinical applications. Based on my robust undergraduate training in statistics and mathematics, I was privileged to get the RA positions at TIMI Study Group and Dana-Farber Cancer Institute at Harvard Medical School. These positions allowed me to conduct various research in interpretable statistical models and survival analysis methodologies. 

Moreover, my research experience during Mahmood Lab at Harvard Medical School, as well as the Laboratory for Computational Physiology at MIT Institute for Medical Engineering & Science, allowed me to further explore the applications of deep learning techniques in public health field. 

## Statistical Modeling Research

* For my research project about interactionRCS R Package development and extension at TIMI Study Group, Harvard Medical School, under supervision of Dr. Andrea Bellavia and Dr. Giorgio Enrico Maria Melloni, please visit [interactionRCS Package](https://kkevin821.github.io/interactionRCS_Package/) page.
  
* For my research project about Average Hazard with Survival Weights in survival analysis at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, under supervision of Dr. Hajime Uno, please visit [Average Hazard with Survival Weights](https://kkevin821.github.io/Average_Hazard/) page.

## Deep Learning Research

* For my research project about outcome prediction under dynamic and time-varying treatment regimes at Laboratory for Computational Physiology at MIT Institute for Medical Engineering & Science, under supervision of Dr. Li-wei H. Lehman, please visit [Patient Outcomes Predictions] (https://kkevin821.github.io/Outcome_Predictions/) page.

* For my research project about multimodal search model for patches from Whole Slide Imaging (WSI) based on pathological captions at Mahmood Lab, Harvard Medical School, under supervision of Dr. Faisal Mahmood, please visit [Multimodal Search Model](https://kkevin821.github.io/Search_Model/) page.
