InteractionRCS R Package Development and Extensions
======
Statistical interpretations in regression models often encounter intricate interactions with continuous covariates. The interactionRCS R package, first developed in 2022, provides a refined tool to decode such complexities using restricted cubic splines. Our ongoing research aims for a more adaptable package, capable of embracing a multitude of spline techniques and accommodating varying regression model, ensuring the package's adaptability to any knot configuration. This initiative is part of a broader exploration at the TIMI Study Group, Harvard Medical School, intersecting the domains of applied clinical research and advanced statistical methodologies.

Outcome Prediction under Dynamic and Time-Varying Treatment Regimes
======
Healthcare often grapples with fluctuating treatment strategies. Tailoring treatment plans as dynamically as they evolve is crucial in maintaining the efficiency of patient care. Our research delves into developing deep learning techniques to realize this vision. A pivotal piece in this endeavor was established by a novel approach based on G-computation for outcome predictions under changing treatment regimes. We're currently pushing boundaries by integrating probabilistic models to further personalize these predictions, setting a new paradigm for patient care.
